# Adminer table header scroll

An adminer plugin that makes the table header scroll with the viewport. Nowadays this should be part of your theme but otherwise this plugin will do it for you.

## Settings
You can change the offset if needed for your theme. For example, the Haekel theme needs `32px` due to the fixed position header.

```php
new AdminerTableHeaderScroll('32px')
```
